# Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions Detection Case Study based on Capital One Data Science Challenge

## Objective:
Fraud is a major issue in the banking industry, and detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial for both financial institutions and their customers. In this challenge, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions, improving the efficiency of business operations and providing better services to customers.

## Dataset: 
The dataset for this challenge can be downloaded from the following link: https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS

## Data Processing:
The dataset contains duplicated transactions, including reversed transactions and multi-swipe transactions. Reversed transactions occur when a purchase is followed by a reversal, while multi-swipe transactions happen when a vendor accidentally charges a customer's card multiple times in a short time span.

## ML algorithms: 
In this challenge, we will explore three machine learning algorithms: Logisitc Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme GradientBoosting (XGBoost). We will evaluate the performance of these algorithms using classification report.

## Evaluation Criteria:
We will evaluate the performance of our predictive model using the following criteria:

Accuracy: the percentage of correctly classified transactions.
Precision Score: the proportion of true positives to the total number of positive predictions.
Recall: the proportion of true positives to the total number of actual positives.
F-1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
